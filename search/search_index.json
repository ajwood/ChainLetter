It's designed to have simple protections, so that not just anyone can add/edit. Only people who have received an official invitation can contribute. Hashes Chainletter entries are added and tracked with hashes ( sha256 ). In addition to acting as an index for the Chainletter entries and links, they serve an authorization mechanism. Partial hashes can be used for normal access (any n-character prefix, enough to uniquely identify a hash), and a full hash grants you write access. When someone shares a hash with you, you use it to login to the system. It must be a full hash (all 64 characters), and only you and the person who gave it to should know it. Since you have the full hash, you'll be able to write a letter to associate with it. After adding the letter, you'll be able to generate new hashes (up to five) to share with others.","title":"Overview"},{"location":"overview/#overview","text":"The Chainletter system is built to be open, without using login accounts.
